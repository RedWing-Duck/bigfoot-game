# Bug list — Week 01: THIS PLACE HAS A BIG FOOTPRINT
Merged from the three QA passes (originals in `qa/`), plus one bug found during the P3 regression pass.
**Status: 34 of 34 fixed. Nothing open.** No duplicates were merged: the QA passes had already de-duplicated against each other.

**Not a bug (GDD note from Critical Path QA):** entering R11 costs no turn, so the critical path ends with 7 turns to spare, not 6. GDD section 9 is corrected in revision 2.

**Editor note:** the ledger, manifest and photos take lines no longer show in play. BR-02 answers "You already have that.", and secrets can't be dropped. The lines are kept in the Script and build, as written.

## Polish build: playtest QA (`qa/PLAYTEST_QA_week01_polish.txt`)
| Bug ID | Sev | Summary | Status | Fix (one line) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| PT-01 | P2 | Bare `listen` got the confused line in R1-R3 | Fixed | Room listen lines from the R1-R3 nouns; QA's tour fallback line |
| PT-02 | P2 | `show X to don` said nobody was there | Fixed | `show` works like `give` (same replies) |
| PT-03 | P2 | `drop coin in fountain` on the tour: "not carrying that" | Fixed | "drop X in Y" means "use X on Y" in both phases (a strike on the tour) |
| PT-04 | P2 | A noun from another room got a category reply and cost a turn | Fixed | Cause: R12's bars list "gate", so "jaguar gate" matched it. Now a longer phrase naming something elsewhere gets the free not-here line. Also removed the rev 2 tour-gate reply, which could only misfire (the gates are on the terrace) |
| PT-05 | P2 | Extra lines pile up in ESCAPE | Fixed | At most 2 extra lines per room (Nando's greeting counts; checkpoint lines, then marks, then the band); no band or feedback on a warning turn |
| PT-06 | P2 | `x stairs` on the landing found nothing | Fixed | "stairs" examines there; `climb stairs` still walks down |
| PT-07 | P3 | Bare `smell` generic in R1-R3 | Fixed | Room smell lines from the R1-R3 nouns |
| PT-08 | P3 | "x cards" found nothing | Fixed | "cards" added to the place cards |
| PT-09 | P3 | "x family photos" found nothing | Fixed | "family photos" / "family photo" added to the frames |
| PT-10 | P3 | The card's IF Q2 line was missing | Fixed | Added; it shares the card's last quote so it isn't printed twice. Also added the missing coin line (ESCAPE, COIN_HELD) |
| PT-11 | P3 | "collector's piece" strike line for the fountain coins | Fixed | QA's Pepita line replaces strike 1 on the hippo and fountain |
| PT-12 | P3 | `eat` on scenery: "Nothing happens" | Fixed | "You're hungry, not desperate." for FIXTURE, FURNITURE, ART |
| PT-13 | P3 | "You see: staircases" under the foyer's escape revisit | Fixed | The revisit text tags [staircase] |
| PT-14 | P3 | "Empty-handed" with one secret | Fixed | QA's one-secret line for "down" and "push button" |
| PT-15 | P3 | Animal marks replaced the whole description | Fixed | Base line + mark for the banister, palms, torn portrait, wallpaper, garden; state changes (giraffe, jaguar, peacocks, aviary door, feathers, vase) still replace |

Root cause for the suite: the extended coverage test now tries every info and Tier 1 verb with no noun in every room and both phases, the Tier 2 verbs on the NPCs present (Nando included, free at a checkpoint), prepositional forms, every noun named from another room (free not-here line), and "look at" + every WORDS entry.

## Polish build: playtest QA round 2 (`qa/PLAYTEST_QA_round2_week01_polish.txt`)
| Bug ID | Sev | Summary | Status | Fix (one line) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| NB-01 | P2 | A bare `say` at a checkpoint was CAUGHT | Fixed | Nando repeats his question; free, the checkpoint stays open |
| NB-02 | P2 | Small talk at Q1 cost a strike | Fixed | Only a "say" with an answer word counts; anything else gets QA's redirect line, no strike |
| NB-03 | P2 | Roleplayed alibis didn't work | Fixed | shout, yell, scream, holler = say; "tell nando <text>" at a checkpoint = say <text> (a bare "tell nando" still repeats, free) |
| NB-04 | P2 | Meta commands got the confused line | Fixed | where (am i), exits / directions / ways out, map, what now / stuck / help me, save / load / undo / restore, back / go back / return, all free, with QA's lines; "go back" at a checkpoint stays a move |
| NB-05 | P3 | "say <words>" with no question pending got the confused line | Fixed | With the Don here: his talk line, or the topic the words name; with nobody here: QA's line (free) |
| NB-06 | P3 | Q1 and Q2 shared a hint ladder | Fixed | Separate ladders; each keeps its own place (a ladder's place is now keyed by its whole list) |
| NB-07 | P3 | "push 13" / "push thirteen" found nothing | Fixed | "13" and "thirteen" name the step and solve P3 |
| NB-08 | P3 | "X and Y" silently dropped Y | Fixed | Does X, then "One thing at a time, detective." (not for say / tell / ask, where "and" is part of what's said) |
| NB-09 | P3 | "tell don i love the marble" got the unknown-topic line | Fixed | Compliment words = the flatter line; new house / marble / palace topic (QA text) |
